# webrtc-tutorial
This repository serves as a hands-on guide for WebRTC. It aims to clearly demonstrate how peer-to-peer connections are established and how video streams are exchanged using WebRTC.

> You can find a more detailed explanation of the basic concepts of WebRTC and this tutorial‚Äôs code in my blog post. <br>

> WebRTC Communication Workflow & APIs and Hooks Used

This tutorial handles not only signaling but all server communications via WebSocket.
To establish a peer-to-peer connection, a signaling process is required.
The steps involved in the signaling process to connection establishment are as follows.

1. Both Peer A and Peer B set up their own media streams(microphone and video) - `Peer A`, `Peer B`
2. One peer (Peer A) creates an SDP(offer) - `Peer A`
3. Peer A sets the generated SDP(offer) as its local description and sends it to Peer B - `Peer A`
4. Peer B receives the SDP(offer) and sets it as its remote description - `Peer B`
5. Peer B creates an SDP(answer) in response to the received SDP(offer)  - `Peer B`
6. Peer B sets its generated SDP(answer) as its local description and sends it to Peer A - `Peer B`
7. Peer A receives the SDP(answer) and sets it as its remote description - `Peer A`
8. Both peers exchange the ICE candidates they collected and add the remote candidates - `Peer A`, `Peer B`
    - Each peer begins gathering its own ICE candidates after completing SDP creation.
A peer can only add the other peer's candidates after setting the remote SDP
9. Once ICE candidate exchange is complete and a viable candidate pair is found, the connection is successfully established - `Peer A`, `Peer B`

- Key APIs required for the signaling process


<br>

- Custom hooks created to utilize these key APIs in accordance with the tutorial code
